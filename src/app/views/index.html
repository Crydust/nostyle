		{{h2({ text: 'About' })}}

		<p class="p">This design system accompanies my book: Form Design Patterns.</p>
		<p class="p">There's a minimal amount of rationale for the patterns in this design system because all of that is covered at great length in the book.</p>

		{{h2({ text: 'Credits' })}}

		<p class="p">The layout and organisation of this design system is heavily inspired and influenced by the <a href="#">GOV.UK Design System</a>.</p>

		<p class="p">The design system is built with Node and deployed to Heroku. I could not have done this without the help of Graham Veal.</p>
